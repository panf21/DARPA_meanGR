# DARPA_meanGR
This is the very first version of regression on the file DOE IV Fake data for machine learning.xlsx. I convert the data from xlsx format into txt format and the code is written in Python.

In order to run the code, you will need to install the following Libs: (with the following Terminal command lines)
1. matplotlib
pip install matplotlib

2. numpy
pip install numpy

3. pandas
pip install pandas

4. sklearn
pip install -U scikit-learn

5. scipy
pip install scipy

After successfully installed all the Libs, execute: python lr.py in Terminal.

The code will return the Coefficients in all dimensions, the residual sum of squares and the variance score.
